# android-xmrig-miner
XMRig miner built inside an android app


This app is based on the proof of concept provided by https://github.com/upost/MoneroMiner

I updated dependencies (libuv-1.23.1 and xmrig-2.8.0-rc)and the project to Android Studio 3.2.


# Compile instructions
Clone the repository and run the following command on base dir:
```
gradle clean :libuv:assembleRelease :app:assembleRelease
```
Then you can sign your .apk in order to install it (release builds must be digital signed before install).

# Dependencies

Android Studio.
Download both SDK and NDK with sdk-manager.
Gradle 4.10.2
